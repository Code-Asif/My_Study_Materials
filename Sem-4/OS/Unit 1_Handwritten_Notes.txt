Unit 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Operating System: An operating system is a program that act as an interface between user computer and computer hardware. It is a system software that enables computer hardware to communicates and operate with other software.

1. Functions of operating System:
	Process Management 
	File 
	Resource
	Security
	Memory
	Communication

2. Types of OS
	1. Batch Operation System
	2. Real Time
	3. Time Sharing
	4. Multiprocessing
	5. Multiprogramming
	6. Embedded
	7. Distributed
	8. Network
	9. Single User

3. Kernel: It is a core of an operating system of a computer
4. Monolithic OS: It controls all aspects of the OS operation including file management, process, memory, device and operational management.


5. 	Parameter				Monolithic							Microkernel

1. 	Size				Big in size							Small in size
2. 	Maintanence			Extra time and resources is neeeded				Easy to handle
3. 	Failure				Failure of one component leads to down the entire system	Failure of one component doesn`t affect other
4. 	Processing speed		Executing speed is high						Execution speed is low
5.	Communication			It uses signal and socket for IPC implementation		It uses messaging queue to implement IPC
6. 	Debugging			Complex								Simple	
7. 	Functionality			Difficult to add new functionality				Easy to add new functionality
8.	Extend				Its not easy to extends						Its easy to extend
9. 	Example				Microsoft Windows 95						Mac OS X

	
6.	Linux									Unix

1. The source code of linux is freely available for its user		The source code for unix is not freely available
2. It has Graphical user interface along with Command line interface	It has only command line interface
3. It is portable and flexible						Unix is not portable
4. versions of linux are- Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Solaris, etc		versions of Unix are- AIS, HP-UX, BSD, Iris, etc

7. System Call: It is a way for appliaction program to interact with Kernel or Operation system. A computer program make a system call when it make a request to the operating system`s kernel. System call provides the services of Operating system to the user application.

8. Types of System call:	
				1. Process Management: fork(), 
				2. Memory: mlock(), munlock(), mmap()
				3. Device:SetConsoleMode(), ReadConsole(), WriteConsole()
				4. File: open(), close(), write(), read(), delete()
				5. Interprocess Communication: pipe(), socket(), semget(), msgget()
